clusterer <dataset> [-o output] [-k n] [-bin b]

dataset is the location of
the folder that contains the images to be clustered. There are also three optional command
line arguments:
1. [-o output]: This is the name of the file that your program will write to. If no output
file is supplied, the program should default to writing the final clusterings to std:cout
2. [-k n]: This is the number of clusters to be generated by the K-means algorithm. It
should default to 10.
3. [-bin b]: This parameter specifies the width of your histogram feature. It should
default to 1.
